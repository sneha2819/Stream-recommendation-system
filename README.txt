STREAM RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

In this system, we have taken the inputs for age (for now age is a fixed age i.e. 16), Favorite Subject,
Hobbies, Subject you are better at, Prefer to work with (numbers or data), 
Type of application you prefer (theory or practical).

The dataset used is a created dataset and does not contain gathered data. 
                                                  
Firstly when user runs the code,the system runs the dataset (collected beforehand) and gives you
which model is more accurate and has more confidence. Then based on the input user gives
the system shows the predicted streams by all 4 models in the system and also calculates 
accuracy and confidence of the predicted answers.                                                
                                                  
This is because sometimes the models will show a bit different answers,
so the user has a choice which stream they want to follow on.
